A personal and back/forward compatible K2 (the popular Joomla extension) fork

NOTE: this is just an EXPERIMENTAL and personal customized version of K2 that I use for my customers sites, 
I share my experiences here under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html GNU/GPL open source license (same of K2 2.5.6) but please if you are looking to use K2
in your Joomla site please go for the original K2 version that you can find at http://getk2.org
